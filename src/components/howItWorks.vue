                Our organization consists of a core team and continent teams. The
                core team consists of a president, vice president, secretary,
                exchequer, and additional core members. Core teams don't have any
                limited time of reign. But if they want to finish their reign, they
                could every "Reign Shifting" and will be replaced by another person.

                While Continental Teams consists of Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa,
                and America. Each continental team will have one head of the
                continent and a minimum of 2/3 members from different countries.
                Continent teams will have one year of reign before "Reign Shifting".
                <br />
                In one year reign, Core Teams will supervise continental teams and
                make programs for all continents to hold. While Continental teams
                will also make programs that they have to hold during their reign
                time. All programs will be created at the beginning of the year with
                a due to 1-month deadline. Afterward, we will hold a big meeting
                where Core and Continental Teams will present their programs for
                their one-year reign.
